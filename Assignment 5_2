1. Calculate the P Value for the test in Problem 2.
2. How do you test the proportions and compare against hypothetical props? Test Hypothesis: proportion
of automatic cars is 40%.
Answer:
  
                            X <- data.frame(row.names(mtcars), mtcars$am)
                            X

                            p0 = 0.4
                            Total = nrow(X)
                            aut = sum(mtcars$am)

                            p_hat = aut / Total Â # Sample proportion

                            # Test statistic
                            z = (p_hat - p0) / sqrt((p0*(1-p0))/Total)
                            z
                            prob = pnorm(z, 0, 1)
                            prob #answer for (1)
